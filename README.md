Code I wrote as a Data Analyst for the Water Center at Penn.


The city of Philadelphia has combined sewer overflows, meaning the sewer pipes carry stormwater and wastewater.
When the pipes are overloaded with water, they will empty into the river.

<b>This research project is aimed towards analyzing bacteria samples from the Delaware and Schuylkill River to better understand the affect of 
rain on bacteria samples.</b>

The samples were collected by both the Philadelphia Water Department and Delaware River Basin Commission for fecal coliform, enterococcus, and e.coli.
There are multiple locations of CSO's along the riverbanks from where the bacteria was sampled. 
Acceptable bacteria amounts for swimming is determined by the EPA.
